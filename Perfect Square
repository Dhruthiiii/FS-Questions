/*write a java program to read a positive number N (i.e., N>0) print the no of divisors of
number N which are perfect squares.

input
36
output
4

for the number 36 the divisors are 
1 2 3 4 6 9 12 18 36
among the above divisors only 1,4,9,36 are perfect squares so the output is 4 

input
60
output
2

for the number 60 the divisors are 
1 2 3 4 5 6 10 12 15 20 30 
among the above divisors only 1,4 are perfect squares so the output is 2

But every number will have at least '1' as divisors which is a perfect square 
so, the output will be 1 

Assume the Number 'N" is a Positive Integer
