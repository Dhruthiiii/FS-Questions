/*
Aadhya is a good programmer in her class. she was given 2 strings, and her mentor asked her to do 
coding on the below scenario 

-merge 2 Strings in an alternate way, i.e.; the final stringâ€™s first character is 
the first character of the first string, the second character of the final string is the 
first character of the second string and so on. 

-if once you reach end of one string while if another string is still remaining then append
the remaining of that string to final string 

sample case:
hello
bye
hbeylelo
