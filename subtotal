/*Write a java program to solve below scenario.

In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him 
how many legs can be counted among all his animals? 
The farmer breeds three species:

chickens = 2 legs
cows = 4 legs
pigs = 4 legs
The farmer has counted his animals and he give you a subtotal for each species. 
You have to implement logic that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

Examples
Sample input:
2   
3     
5
output: 36

Sample input:
1 
2   
3
output: 22

Sample input:
5  
2   
8
output: 50

Notes
The order of animals passed is animals (chickens, cows, pigs).
Remember that the farmer wants to know the total number of legs and not the total number of animals.
if given number is negative then print "Invalid"
