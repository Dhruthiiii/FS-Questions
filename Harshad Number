/* Write a Java program to check whether a number is a Harshad Number or not.
A Harshad number in a given number base, 
is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits when written in that base.
Ex: Number 200 is a Harshad Number because the sum of digits 2 and 0 and 0 is 2 i.e. (2+0+0 = 2) 
and 200 is divisible by 2. 
Number 171 is a Harshad Number because the sum of digits 1 and 7 and 1 is 9 i.e. (1+7+1 =9) 
and 171 is divisible by 9.

Harshad Number is also called as Niven Number.

Note: If Harshad Number print 1 else -1.

Sample Input: 
171
Sample Output:
1

Sample Input: 
11
Sample Output:
-1
